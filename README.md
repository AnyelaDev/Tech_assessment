# Technical Assessment

## Task: 
The task is to use **Claude Code** to reimagine a project you previously worked on. You are free to use whatever language, frameworks, and tools you wish. You do not need to finish the entire project or even have anything working -- the only constraint is to spend **no more than 6 hours on this. The deliverable is a GitHub repo with the project code and a README.md file containing a reflection on your experiences using the tool. In particular, discuss how far you got, what challenges you ran into, and how the architecture or approach taken compared to the previous version you worked on.

## Log
- **17:13** I started with reimagining how to merge two of my projects into one, and using a different stack of tech. I am also hoping to add AI into it, because, why not?
- **17:23** I will start with a readme.md as a map of the current status of development "user facing" style. I will also keep a folder for planning markdown files. I think it helps me keep it all tidy when working with Claude. 
- **18:45** AI integration implementation in the backend done. I tried this time to go backend first, front end second, but It is making my life harder than necessary. Time to add ui and make some progress.
- **21:20** UI is working. I had a bunch of problems because I accidentally added a space ad the end of a folder name. It took a while for claude and me to figure it out. 
- **01:06** I am over the 6 hour mark. I am not very happy because I spent about 90 minutes total wresling with the space in the name mistake, which affected tests and was hard to spot. Probably around 4,5 hours of effective work. I also tried to use hugging face API to run inferences remotely. I though it was going to be much easier, I ended up just using claude for it. 
- **01:49** AI integration is working, promts are working well, I could try to make them better but polishing will be left for another time. 
- **03:22** I am having too much fun working. I missed this! however, I am very tired. It's pretty late!

## Self evaluation and qualitative description of the exercise

> In particular, discuss **how far you got**, 

I got very far in comparison with my original project, because It had a terrible UI, I was using Kivy, which was recommended to me for being a "beinner" in Frontend. I 100% porcent preffer this approach with HTTP and using Django templates. Also, the AI integration, which I had postmoned in my other project, is working in this one, so great! It was a battle, but I am happy.

>what **challenges** you ran into, 

HuggingFace and its API... I couldnt make it work!

Then I  didnt notice my folder was originally named "reimagined " with an extra space at the end. And when I tried to "fix it" My whole venv exploted. I ended up creating the env again from scratch. but I was nervous that something would break my whole project. a bit paranoid, I know. 

I learned a bunch about venvs in the process, though.

> and how the **architecture or approach** taken compared to the previous version you worked on.

The "reimagining" here was basically I would try tackling first the part of the project that I postponed initially: Integrating and testing LLM, using HuggingFace, which I heard was a potential "free" option for this. and I wanted to use Claude to get it to work. But I couldnt. I used a lot of my time there, I wanted to avoid costs. At a certain point, I just had to get the ball rolling. and I switched gears to Claude. 

I switched my approach in terms of not traying to use github tools as much, since my "coworker" (Claude) lives in my terminal, not in github. 

So I started using *.md files to make Claude notice my manual testing results, and find the bugs. The Issues.md became a great tool for mentally mapping out the work needed and tackle issues one by one. 

I gave general guidelines via Workflow.md and asking Claude to keep updating Claude.md

I also used ChatGPT to look at some content in my github and make an objective assessment and give recommendations. I told claude it was feedback from the architect of the project. Since this assignment is timed, I chose to use these tools, and look at general aspects to try and catch bad code, and avoid building trash on top of trash. 

This happened to me in my previous projects, I ended up having an enourmous test suite of mocked functions. I tried to avoid it here at all costs. Though I continued to uncover and fix issues along the way. 

I feared the testing of the AI implementation would become too expensive, so I explicitly made it difficult to run those tests in the workflow. I hope it worked!

## Work Timeline and Progress

| Event | Time | Commit Link | Major Progress and Challenges |
|-------|------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Time I started** | 17:13 | *Project initialization* | Started reimagining project merge with new tech stack + AI integration |
| **6 hours of work mark** | 01:06 | [`ce16694`](../../commit/ce16694) - UI fixes (01:04)<br>[`b8cb2ce`](../../commit/b8cb2ce) - backend fixes (01:02) | UI working, but lost ~90 min to space-in-folder-name bug. HuggingFace API pivot to Claude |
| **6 hours effective work** | ~02:30 | [`a2c01c4`](../../commit/a2c01c4) - Plan refining (02:23) | AI integration working, prompts functional, plan refinement phase |
| **Too tired to continue (8.5 hours)** | 03:30 | [`ed2c743`](../../commit/ed2c743) - Issues 6 & 7 completed (03:25)<br>[`ce5c14e`](../../commit/ce5c14e) - Enhanced models with validation (03:20) | **Final push:** Successfully completed major feature work - enhanced models, task_id, priority fields, validation |

**Key Technical Pivots:**
- üîÑ **Backend-first approach** proved more challenging than expected
- üö´ **HuggingFace API integration failed** ‚Üí switched to Claude Sonnet
- üêõ **Space-in-folder-name** cost 90 minutes of debugging time. I might have been a bit sleepy too. 
- ‚úÖ **AI integration successful** with working prompts and inference
