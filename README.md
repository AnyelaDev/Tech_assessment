The task is to use Claude Code to reimagine a project you previously worked on. You are free to use whatever language, frameworks, and tools you wish. You do not need to finish the entire project or even have anything working -- the only constraint is to spend no more than 6 hours on this. The deliverable is a GitHub repo with the project code and a README.md file containing a reflection on your experiences using the tool. In particular, discuss how far you got, what challenges you ran into, and how the architecture or approach taken compared to the previous version you worked on.

17:13 I started with reimagining how to merge two of my projects into one, and using a different stack of tech. I am also hoping to add AI into it, because, why not?
17:23 I will start with a readme.md as a map of the current status of development "user facing" style. I will also keep a folder for planning markdown files. I think it helps me keep it all tidy when working with Claude. 
18:45 AI integration implementation in the backend done. I tried this time to go backend first, front end second, but It is making my life harder than necessary. Time to add ui. 
19:48 I spent a total of 40 minuts wrestling the API key problem. The answer was easier to find by asking the agent in anthropic website. I am not counting that time in the test. I hope its okay.
