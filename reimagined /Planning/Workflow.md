We will follow Test Driven Development Best practices from the start. 
We will not Over-mock tests. We will test functionality and actual behavior.
We will keep a basic UI, and the color scheme will be managed in the simplest way possible, avoiding hardcoding. We will select a color palette and reference the colors appropriately.
We will start with the core function: LLM integration.

## Development Workflow
- Stop after completing each todo item to show progress
- Wait for user confirmation before continuing to next task
- This allows for review and feedback at each step
