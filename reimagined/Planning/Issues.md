# List of issues by claude here. 

## Issue 1
**Title:** Fix Hugging Face Integration - Use Remote API Instead of Local Model

**Description:** Current HF integration tries to download and run models locally instead of using remote inference API, causing performance issues or failures.

**Acceptance criteria:** 
- [ ] Replace `transformers.pipeline()` with `huggingface_hub.InferenceClient`
- [ ] Create `HFClient` wrapper class for remote inference
- [ ] Inject HFClient into TaskGroomer for testability
- [ ] Remove transformers dependency from request path

**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High

## Issue 2
**Title:** Define Minimal Models Explicitly

**Description:** Task and TaskList models need clear structure and validation to support the core functionality.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Create TaskList model (name, raw_input, created_at)
- [ ] Create Task model (task_list FK, title, estimated_minutes, can_overlap)
- [ ] Add proper model validation
- [ ] Consider depends_on M2M relationship for future

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** High

## Issue 3
**Title:** Implement Meaningful Tests (Currently Mostly Placeholders)

**Description:** Tests exist as scaffolding but lack meaningful assertions and behavior validation.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Unit test for TaskGroomer.process_todo() with stubbed LLM response
- [ ] Model tests for TaskList and Task validation
- [ ] Integration test for views with error handling
- [ ] Routing/smoke tests for URL resolution
- [ ] Edge case tests (empty lines, malformed durations, duplicates)

**Impact:** High
**Priority:** Medium

## Issue 4
**Title:** Improve Configuration Management and Security

**Description:** Secrets are coupled to Django settings and need better management to avoid exposure.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Add .env.example file with required keys

- [ ] Ensure API keys are never printed or exposed
- [ ] Centralize configuration management

- [ ] Return pure data objects (dataclass) instead of Django models
- [ ] Implement mapping to models in view or repository layer
- [ ] Create clean service boundaries

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium
