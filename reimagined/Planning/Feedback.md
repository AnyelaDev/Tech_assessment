# Issue 19 - Pomodoro Timer Implementation Questions

Before starting implementation, these aspects need clarification:

## Scope Questions to Answer:

### 1. **Page Structure & Navigation**
- The Pomodoro timer runs on a separate page/route: http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/pomodoro 
- Users return to the main executive function features during/after a pomodoro session by pressing a button which says: "Back"

### 2. **Timer Implementation Details**
- **Progress Bar Type**: JavaScript-driven visualization?
- **Timer Accuracy**: basic `setInterval` is sufficient
- **State Persistence**: once any timer is done, a visual notification should show and the user should be taken to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/pomodoro screen. If the user was writing anything, that data should persist.  Survives navigation, does not survive refresh. 

### 3. **User Experience Flow**
- Can users pause/stop/reset timers mid-cycle? yes.
- Should there be audio/visual notifications when timers complete? a visual notification.
- Any keyboard shortcuts or accessibility features needed? not for now.

### 4. **Integration with Existing System**
- Should completed pomodoros be tracked/logged in the database? No
- Any connection to the existing task management features? We will use the timer features in the future. The timer feature will be editable, meaning users will chose the duration of their timers. progress bar feature will be used also. 
- Does this need authentication or can it work for anonymous users? no authentication is needed at all. 

### 5. **Testing Strategy** 
- Given the TDD approach, how do we test JavaScript timers? we run the real timers. no mocking.
- Do we need integration tests for the full cycle, or focus on unit tests for timer logic? we need to start with unit tests, and then full cycle. 

### 6. **Technical Architecture**
- Pure client-side JavaScript or do we need server-side state management? Client-side
- Should timer state survive page refreshes? no

### 7. **Real vs Demo Timers**
- The spec says 5-second timers - is this intentional for demo/testing, or should it be configurable for real 25-minute pomodoros? Ideally should be configurable, but keep default of 5 seconds for easy manual tessting.
