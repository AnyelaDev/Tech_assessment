{{Implement the pomodoro screen. 
when the user clicks on "Pomodoro" button here http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/ , the pomodoro algorithm starts. 

this is the pomodoro algorithm:
- It should start a timer of 5 seconds, showing a progress bar. 
- When the timer is done, the screen turns to a dark blue color and shows the text in white: "Time for a break" with a button that says: "Start Break". 
- When the button is pressed, a timer of 5 seconds starts, showing a progress bar. 
- when this timer ends, the screen turns white and text with teal color: "New pomodoro?" with a button that says: "start pomodoro. 
When the button is pressed, the pomodoro algorithm starts again }}
