# Issue 21 - Fix "Groom my list" Regression Questions

Before starting work, these aspects need clarification:

## Key Questions to Answer:

### 1. Current Behavior
- What exactly does the "mocking" response look like when clicking "Groom my list"? it justssends a post request, but the UI shows nothing, its not moving to the next screen with the tasks list, and the input fields get emptied.
- Is it showing fake data, error messages, or placeholder content?None of these. it just clears everything and stays in http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/todo-timeline/process/

### 2. Timeline 
- When exactly did this regression occur? (after which commit/change?) after Implementing Issue 19 or Issue 20 fix. Both have been merged into the master branch. In a0c23133449f03a65bedbdea5c6917e32e0fbf46 it was working.
- Was AI integration working immediately before pomodoro implementation? I think yes.

### 3. Code Changes
- Which specific files were modified during pomodoro implementation (Issue 19)? look it up with git commands.

### 4. Environment/Configuration
- Are Claude API credentials still properly configured? I think so. Do we have implementation or error handling that will show if the API credentials dont work? We should also comunicate it to the user via UI if it happens. 
- Is there a test flag or mock mode accidentally enabled? I think yes. But I cant confirm please investigate
- Are there any new environment variables needed? No

### 5. Integration Analysis
- Do pomodoro and AI grooming share any common code paths? they do. I explicitely asked the timer function to be created in a way that we will be able to use in a later stage after AI grooming. In fact we might need to separate the code in apps. The AI grooming is an app, the tasks creation is another, the pomodoro algorithm is another, the timers is another app. Task creation used the AI grooming result and timers. The pomodoro algorithm uses the timers as well. 
- Are there URL routing conflicts or view function interference? we have to check, and also write tests for that in our test suite if there are no tests for this.

### 6. Testing Approach
- How do we test the fix without expensive API calls during development? create a "cheap AI test" which sends a specific todo_text in the groom_tasks function. like Â´If cheap_AI_test: todo_text="""Make 25 sandwiches""", context "I dont know if I have enough food"
- Should we verify both pomodoro AND AI grooming work independently? yes
