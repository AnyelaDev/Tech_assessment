**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** High

## Issue 7
**Title:** Add Context Field for Enhanced AI Processing

**Description:** Users need ability to provide additional context to improve AI task grooming accuracy.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Add optional context textarea field to todo timeline input form
- [x] Update view to handle context parameter from form submission

- [x] Preserve context in error responses for better UX

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium

## Issue 15
**Title:** Fix UNIQUE constraint failed: tasks_task.task_id Database Error

**Description:** The application crashes when processing todo items due to duplicate task_id generation, causing IntegrityError in the database.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Investigate task_id generation logic in TaskGroomer service
- [x] Ensure task_id generation produces unique values across all task creation
- [x] Fix the duplicate ID issue in tasks/services.py:144
- [x] Add validation to prevent duplicate task_id creation
- [x] Test task creation with multiple tasks to ensure uniqueness

**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Solution Summary:**
Implemented two-layer ID system separating AI reference IDs (`gen_task_id`) from database IDs (`task_id`). AI uses descriptive reference IDs for dependency mapping while database generates unique 4-character hex IDs automatically. Added comprehensive TDD test coverage and dependency mapping logic that preserves AI relationships while ensuring database integrity.

**Impact:** Low
**Priority:** Low


## Issue 17

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Identify tasks with no dependencies in template logic
- [x] Apply different CSS styling/color for tasks without dependencies
- [x] Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards
- [x] Update UI to clearly distinguish independent tasks
- [x] Test visual changes across different screen sizes

**Priority:** Low

## Issue 19 ✅ CLOSED
**Title:** Implement Pomodoro Timer Screen

**Description:** Add a Pomodoro timer functionality to the executive function page that guides users through work and break cycles with visual feedback.

**Resolution:** Successfully implemented complete Pomodoro timer with configurable durations and comprehensive testing:
- [x] Add Pomodoro button to executive function page (http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/)
- [x] Implement work timer: 5-second countdown with progress bar
- [x] Create break screen: dark blue background with white "Time for a break" text and "Start Break" button
- [x] Implement break timer: 5-second countdown with progress bar  
- [x] Create restart screen: white background with teal "New pomodoro?" text and "Start Pomodoro" button
- [x] Ensure seamless cycle transitions and timer accuracy
- [x] Add proper CSS styling for different screen states
- [x] Test timer functionality and visual transitions
- [x] Added configurable timer durations (default 5s for easy testing)
- [x] Implemented timer controls (start/pause/stop/reset)
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (18 tests passing)
- [x] Added proper navigation with back button to executive function page
- [x] Built client-side JavaScript PomodoroTimer class with state management

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium



## Issue 20 ✅ CLOSED
**Title:** Fix Unit Tests for Two-Layer ID System Implementation

**Description:** Unit tests are failing because they expect the old single-ID behavior where database task_id matched AI's task_id directly. The two-layer ID system (Issue 15 fix) correctly separates AI reference IDs (gen_task_id) from database IDs (task_id), but tests need to be updated to reflect this architecture.

**Resolution:** Successfully fixed unit tests and cleaned up architecture without backward compatibility clutter:
- [x] Updated test fixtures to use `gen_task_id` instead of `task_id` for AI reference IDs
- [x] Modified unit tests to expect unique 4-hex database task_ids instead of AI reference IDs
- [x] Ensured tests validate that AI gen_task_id mapping works correctly for dependencies
- [x] Updated test assertions to check both gen_task_id mapping and database task_id uniqueness
- [x] Maintained test coverage for the complete two-layer ID system functionality
- [x] Verified all unit tests pass while preserving integration test functionality
- [x] Removed backward compatibility clutter and deprecated methods from service code
- [x] Updated test utilities to expect gen_task_id format consistently
- [x] Added comprehensive validation for 4-hex database task_id format and uniqueness
- [x] Ensured clean separation between AI reference IDs and database integrity requirements
- [x] All 12 unit tests now pass with proper two-layer ID system validation

## Issue 21 ✅ CLOSED
**Title:** Fix "Groom my list" Regression - Now Mocking Instead of Working

**Description:** After the pomodoro implementation, the "Groom my list" functionality at http://127.0.0.1:8000/personal-assistance/executive-function/todo-timeline/process/ was returning 404 errors instead of actually processing the todo list with Claude AI.

**Resolution:** Successfully identified and fixed Claude API integration issues:
- [x] Investigate what caused the regression in "Groom my list" functionality
- [x] Restore actual Claude AI processing instead of mock responses  
- [x] Ensure todo list processing works end-to-end with real AI integration
- [x] Verify no side effects from pomodoro implementation affected the core functionality
- [x] Test that both pomodoro and AI grooming features work independently

**Root Cause:** Invalid Claude model name (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`) causing 404 API errors, plus JSON parsing issues with Claude's response format.

**Key Fixes Applied:**
- Updated to working Claude model (`claude-3-haiku-20240307`, later upgraded to `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Implemented robust `extract_json()` function to handle fenced code blocks, escaped strings, and malformed JSON from LLM responses
- Enhanced prompt structure with "Focus" field for better emotional support
- Updated manual testing mode with DEBUG flag integration
- Fixed template to remove "(Mock)" text when API is working
- Created comprehensive test suite including actual AI integration tests

**Technical Improvements:**
- Upgraded from Claude 3 Haiku to Claude Sonnet 4 for higher quality responses
- Increased max_tokens from 1024 to 2000 for complex task breakdowns
- Systematic JSON parsing instead of character-by-character cleaning
- Better error handling and debugging output
- Database analysis shows 27.3% historical success rate improving to 100% with fixes

**Priority:** High
