# Completed Issues

## Issue #1 ✅ CLOSED
**Title:** LLM Service

**Description:** Initial AI integration for intelligent task breakdown and analysis.

**Resolution:** Successfully implemented Claude Sonnet 3.5 integration with comprehensive testing:
- [x] Claude API integration with error handling
- [x] Intelligent task breakdown from free-form text
- [x] Priority assignment and time estimation
- [x] Task dependency management
- [x] Modern UI with table display and analysis
- [x] Comprehensive test suite (unit/integration/e2e)
- [x] Database model enhancements (task_id, priority fields)
- [x] Cost protection system with --AItest-ON flag

**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High

## Issue 6 ✅ CLOSED
**Title:** Define Minimal Models Explicitly

**Description:** Task and TaskList models need clear structure and validation to support the core functionality.

**Resolution:** Successfully implemented comprehensive model enhancements and UI fixes:
- [x] TaskList model supports todo_text and context inputs (no name required)
- [x] Task model with task_list FK, title, estimated_duration, can_run_parallel
- [x] Fix task_id generation: program-controlled 4-byte hex format
- [x] Add proper model validation: required fields, circular dependency prevention
- [x] Fix dependencies display in UI: show dependent task IDs instead of "Task.None"
- [x] Add dependency management: 0000 removes, valid hex adds (max 4 dependencies)

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** High

## Issue 7
**Title:** Add Context Field for Enhanced AI Processing

**Description:** Users need ability to provide additional context to improve AI task grooming accuracy.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Add optional context textarea field to todo timeline input form
- [x] Update view to handle context parameter from form submission
- [x] Connect context to TaskGroomer service and Claude API calls
- [x] Include context in LLM prompt for better task analysis
- [x] Preserve context in error responses for better UX

**Impact:** Medium
**Priority:** Medium

## Issue 15
**Title:** Fix UNIQUE constraint failed: tasks_task.task_id Database Error

**Description:** The application crashes when processing todo items due to duplicate task_id generation, causing IntegrityError in the database.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [x] Investigate task_id generation logic in TaskGroomer service
- [x] Ensure task_id generation produces unique values across all task creation
- [x] Fix the duplicate ID issue in tasks/services.py:144
- [x] Add validation to prevent duplicate task_id creation
- [x] Test task creation with multiple tasks to ensure uniqueness

**Impact:** High
**Priority:** High
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Solution Summary:**
Implemented two-layer ID system separating AI reference IDs (`gen_task_id`) from database IDs (`task_id`). AI uses descriptive reference IDs for dependency mapping while database generates unique 4-character hex IDs automatically. Added comprehensive TDD test coverage and dependency mapping logic that preserves AI relationships while ensuring database integrity.
