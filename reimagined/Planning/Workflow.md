# General Guidelines:
- We will follow Test Driven Development Best practices from the start. 
- We will not Over-mock tests. We will test functionality and actual behavior.
- We will keep a basic UI, and the color scheme will be managed in the simplest way possible.
- **TDD is invaluable for API integrations** - caught multiple edge cases
- **Real testing > extensive mocking** - found issues mocks would miss
- **Clear organization scales** - well-structured tests are maintainable tests
- **Documentation is code** - good docs prevent confusion and mistakes


## Development Workflow:

### When starting a new Issue fix:
- Look at the Issue section in Issues.md and ask questions that will help scope the work, refine acceptance criteria, define the route and plan the solution. 
- Ask questions about the expected behavior

### When planning work
- Follow TDD best practices. Write meaningful tests. 

### About tests
- Unit tests, integration tests, regresion tests should be written. 
- Test files should be kept organized.
- Keep in mid the goal is: Real TDD Benefits Demonstrated
- **Caught and fixed bugs**: Time parsing edge case discovered through tests
- **Refactoring confidence**: Could reorganize tests knowing coverage existed
- **Documentation as tests**: Test names serve as specification
- **Quality assurance**: Every feature thoroughly validated

### In "accept edits on" mode
- Stop after completing each todo item to show progress
- Wait for user confirmation before continuing to next task
- This allows for review and feedback at each step
- Check Issues.md for Claude tasks in double curly brackets and execute them
